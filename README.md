## Description 

If you are an outdoor enthusiast and love to talk all about your outdoor adventures, then Adventureops is for you. With Adventureops, the user can create an username and password to be stored into our database to be used for future logins. Once the login information is created the user is presented with a homepage that has a feed section and a section to create post. The user can speak their mind about the outdoor activity of their choice and assign that post to the specific activity and location on where it happened. The user can also organize their feed to only display all the post of a specific outdoor activity that they and other users created. The user can also select on "Your Post" to view post they created and also organize it by a specific outdoor activity.
